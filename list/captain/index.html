      <h3>
          Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen), his wife Leslie and their six children<br> 
          live deep in the wilderness of Washington state. Isolated from society,<br> 
          Ben and Leslie devote their existence to raising their kids --<br> 
          educating them to think critically, training them to be physically <br>
          fit and athletic, guiding them in the wild without technology and <br>
          demonstrating the beauty of co-existing with nature.<br>
          When Leslie dies suddenly, Ben must take his sheltered <br>
          offspring into the outside world for the first time.<br>
